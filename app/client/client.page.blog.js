			'<strong>Time machine.</strong> Time can be paused and rewinded. When time is paused, the code can be inspected more thoroughly. Hovering over an element in the canvas shows which line of code has drawn that item, and vice versa.</p>',
			'<p>Normally a programmer would have to simulate how a program works in her head. <em>This was drawn here, that there.</em> Why should that be necessary? Computers can just <em>show</em> us what happens.</p>',

			'<p>Of course, it is still possible to change the program. When doing that, the program is re-run for the last couple of seconds. This way one can discover how the program behaves over time.</p>',
			'</div>',
			'<div class="blog-movie-piece">',
			'<p><div class="movie-games-4" style="margin-top: 0px"></div>',
			'<strong>Following the flow.</strong> Sometimes programs have to be inspected in detail to understand how they work. Traditional environments already allow programmers to go through a program step by step. This means that they don’t have to simulate everything in their heads. However, usually only stepping forward is allowed, making it impossible to skip back a few steps, to check what happened before.</p>',

For example, instead of showing circles we could show variable contents and thumbnails of shapes on the canvas, as suggested in Learnable Programming. Experimenting with different visualisations should reveal which ones support creation and discovery best.</p>',
			'<p>Even though this implementation only works with simple games, it shows that it is actually possible to implement Victorian interactions in a real-world context. In fact, the canvas on the left is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/HTML/Canvas">standard web component</a>, which has only been <a href="https://github.com/janpaul123/jsdares/blob/master/jsmm-applet/output/output.canvas.js">slightly modified</a> to support these interactions.

In his landmark book <a href="http://books.google.nl/books/about/Mindstorms.html?id=HhIEAgUfGHwC">Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas</a>, he describes how children learn to program robots, called <em>turtles</em>.

By lowering this maximum we can force students to find ways of shortening the program.</p>',
			'<p>After showing how to use functions in the example programs, they can copy the syntax when writing their own programs.

			'<p>In the <a href="#" class="blog-dares-zigzag arrow-link">next dare</a>, we provide no example, and we lower the maximum number of lines so that students have to figure out some way of keeping the program short. This is a natural way of discovering how to use functions. My field trials support this, as most students had no problems learning about functions this way, without any instructions.</p>',
			'<p>In order to avoid writing obfuscated programs, empty lines are not counted, and the parser forces newlines between statements. For more complicated dares, other variations can be tried, such as a maximum number of loops allowed, only allowing certain statements, or limiting the total number of steps.</p>',

They must match 95% of the original image, which is visualised by overlaying the original image with red and green pixels when submitting the solution.</p>',

Building an online platform allows students who are not receiving formal education to learn in a better way than they would traditionally, such as by reading tutorials.</p>',
				'<p>Gradually these programming tools will get better, and they will become more capable of handling real-world projects. At the same time, more and more students will learn this way, and they will start building real-world projects using visual programming. It will slowly take over, until after a while it is <em>so much better</em>, that people will switch over completely. That is what we should be aiming for, and jsdares is just a small step into that direction.</p>',

			'<p>With jsdares I want to show that it is possible to implement a very visual programming interface in a real-world environment. Now we should create a larger ecosystem of visual programming tools. There are already projects out there that we can use, such as IDEs, editors, and languages. We should also adapt components to support interactions such as rewinding and replaying time.</p>',
			'<p>I have focused on education, but there are more domains in which visual programming can be implemented relatively easily, such as spreadsheets, artistic programming, markup languages, and software prototyping. We can extract components from jsdares for reuse in other projects.</p>',
			'<p>To me, education is close to my heart. It would be great to keep improving jsdares, especially since there is a <a href="https://github.com/janpaul123/jsdares/issues">huge backlog</a> of exciting ideas.</p>',
